# AVP400
The final exam for the "Advanced programming with C#" course at the University.
ASP.Net was a requirement, as was an MVC user website, a Windows Forms admin-GUI and a relational database.
The project is a website that shows books and their authors, with the necessary parts to make that work. 
A simple scan goes through the import file every 60 seconds, to automaticly import any new books.
